The goal of MicroLabR is to consolidate a range of useful and common
calculations from molecular biology, virology, and microbiology all into
a single package of functions and shiny apps. Over a number of years
Iâ€™ve generated multiple formula based excel spreadsheets and standalone
Shiny apps that have been passed around the lab group or with external
colleagues, and I felt that having everything in one place would make
life a bit easier and version control much simpler.
