# MicroLabR

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MicroLabR is to consolidate a range of useful and common calculations from molecular biology, virology, and microbiology all into a single package of functions and shiny apps. Over a number of years I've generated multiple formula based excel spreadsheets and standalone Shiny apps that have been passed around the lab group or with external colleagues, and I felt that having everything in one place would make life a bit easier and version control much simpler.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MicroLabR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alegione/MicroLabR")
```
